# Description

The first routing app that routes you the SAFEST way, not the fastest way. Great for unsuitable weather conditions, new drivers, bad road infrastructure, and more. The app works by predicting the probability of vehicle crashes at a certain location given several inputs like precipitation chance and amount, temperature, time of day, past crashes, and sinuosity of the road.
